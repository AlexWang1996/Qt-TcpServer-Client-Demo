# Qt-TcpServer-Client-Demo
  This is a simple demo for tcp/ip protocol in Qt
  
  The client can open a file which user wants to send to the server and click send to begin
  
  The server will display what it receives from the client on the Texteditor and send "received" to the client
  
  The mutithread server enables different clients connected to it and it processes the data in different threads
  
  This demo is simple and if users would like to build a robust server with multithreads, they should change the framework of this demo and add more complex functions
